# Breaking changes in v18

- `eslint-plugin-babel-compiler` superseded by `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` v7. Consumers will need to remove direct `react-compiler/react-compiler` references.
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` upgraded from "warn" to "error" severity, and so will surface new errors for existing warn violations that are not suppressed by `// eslint-disable`.
