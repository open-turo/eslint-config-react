# Breaking changes in v19

- Sets `react-hooks/todo` to error on React Compiler de-opt syntax.
  - As a work-around, either `// eslint-disable` existing violations, or re-write code to use syntax that allows for compiler optimization.
- Ports over changes from `recommended.cjs` to `index.cjs`, as we have not kept rules in sync.
  - The breaking changes from v18 will surface in usages that use the ESLint v9 flat config instead of the legacy `/recommended` config.
