# Breaking changes in v13

We are adding `eslint-plugin-react-compiler` to our React configuration. While there is much more work needed to support React Compiler in production, adding the ESLint rule in advance of the actual compiler (which is recommended by the React team: https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler#installing-eslint-plugin-react-compiler) will help us resolve (or suppress) violations as they come up. This addition requires a major version upgrade since it will raise errors in every repo.
